* TI OMAP SDMA controller

Required properties:
- compatible: 		Must be "ti,omap-sdma"
- reg: 			Contains DMA registers location and length.
- interrupts: 		Contains DMA interrupt information.
- #dma-cells: 		Must be 1.
- #dma-channels:	Contains total number of programmable DMA channels.
- #dma-requests:	Contains total number of DMA requests.

Example:

	sdma: dma-controller@4A056000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap-sdma";
		reg = <0x4A056000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 12 0x4>,
			     <0 13 0x4>,
			     <0 14 0x4>,
			     <0 15 0x4>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
		#dma-channels = <32>;
		#dma-requests = <127>;
	};


* TI OMAP SDMA clients

Required properties:
- dmas:			List of one or more DMA specifiers, each consisting of
			- A phandle pointing to DMA controller node
			- The DMA request number associated with client device
- dma-names: 		Contains one identifier string for each dma specifier in
			the dmas property. The specific strings that can be used
			are defined in the binding of the DMA client device.

Example:

	mmc1: mmc@4809c000 {
		...
		dmas = <&sdma 61>,	/* TX channel */
		       <&sdma 62>;	/* RX channel */
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
		...
	};
